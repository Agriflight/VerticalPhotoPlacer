# Vertical Photo Placer

![VPP](https://github.com/verticalphotoplacer/VerticalPhotoPlacer/blob/master/icon/app_smaller.png?raw=true) The Vertical Photo Placer (VPP) is a free open source plugin for QGIS that performs quick placement of vertical drone photos on map.

The objective of VPP is to provide a tool for quickly geo-referencing and visualization of vertical drone photos on map. Geo-reference is done by generating a world file for each photo according to ESRI specification, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_file for detailed information.

This plugin should be used in cases when quick information visualization is needed such as disaster response. If geo-referencing accuracy is top priority, other tools should be considered.
